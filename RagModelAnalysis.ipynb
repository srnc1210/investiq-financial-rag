The federal funds rate can influence the overall direction of the economy, including inflation and employment rates.\n",

Participants noted that monetary policy would be informed by a wide range of incoming data, the economic outlook, and the balance of risks. Most participants assessed that some reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate this year would likely be appropriate, noting that upward pressure on inflation from tariffs may be temporary or modest, that medium- and longer-term inflation expectations had remained well anchored, or that some weakening of economic activity and labor market conditions could occur. A couple of participants noted that, if the data evolve in line with their expectations, they would be open to considering a reduction in the target range for the policy rate as soon as at the next meeting. Some participants saw the most likely appropriate path of monetary policy as involving no reductions in the target range for the federal funds rate this year, noting that recent inflation readings had continued to exceed the Committee's 2 percent goal, that upside risks to inflation remained meaningful in light of factors such as elevated short-term inflation expectations of businesses and households, or that they expected that the economy would remain resilient.

By contrast, the implied modal federal funds rate path from options was little changed, consistent with the interpretation that the baseline outlook had not changed materially. The Open Market Desk's Survey of Market Expectations told a similar story, as the median respondent's modal path for the federal funds rate in 2025 was little changed. The expected timing of rate cuts in 2026 and 2027 was brought forward about a quarter, but the expected terminal rate was unchanged. Survey respondents, however, attached noticeably higher probabilities to both lower gross domestic product (GDP) growth outcomes and higher inflation outcomes for 2025 compared with the January survey, consistent with a higher perceived risk of a negative supply shock this year.\", \"Conditions in U.S. short-term funding markets remained generally stable over the intermeeting period, with the lowering of the target range for the federal funds rate in December fully passing through to both secured and unsecured reference rates. Rates in secured markets exhibited temporary, and typical, upward pressure around year-end. Excluding the year-end period, rates in secured markets declined somewhat relative to the effective federal funds rate, likely reflecting the effects of the nearly full pass-through of December's technical adjustment to the ON RRP offering rate and of declining bill issuance.

They discussed a set of core labor market indicators used to help assess maximum employment, including the unemployment rate, job vacancies, the employment-to-population (EPOP) ratio, and the labor force participation rate (LFPR), and described the use of these indicators in assessing maximum employment during the pandemic-related recession and subsequent economic recovery.

The ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers was 1.1 in February, a bit below its average over 2019, and the quits rate edged up to 2.1 percent in January but was still well below its 2019 average. The total employment cost index for private-sector workers rose 3.6 percent over the 12 months ending in December, well below its year-earlier level. Average hourly earnings for all employees rose 4.0 percent over the 12 months ending in February, little changed from a year ago.', \"In considering the outlook for monetary policy, participants generally agreed that, with economic growth and the labor market still solid and current monetary policy moderately or modestly restrictive, the Committee was well positioned to wait for more clarity on the outlook for inflation and economic activity. Participants noted that monetary policy would be informed by a wide range of incoming data, the economic outlook, and the balance of risks. Most participants assessed that some reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate this year would likely be appropriate, noting that upward pressure on inflation from tariffs may be temporary or modest, that medium- and longer-term inflation expectations had remained well anchored, or that some weakening of economic activity and labor market conditions could occur. A couple of participants noted that, if the data evolve in line with their expectations, they would be open to considering a reduction in the target range for the policy rate as soon as at the next meeting. Some participants saw the most likely appropriate path of monetary policy as involving no reductions in the target range for the federal funds rate this year, noting that recent inflation readings had continued to exceed the Committee's 2 percent goal, that upside risks to inflation remained meaningful in light of factors such as elevated short-term inflation expectations of businesses and households, or that they expected that the economy would remain resilient. Several participants commented that the current target range for the federal funds rate may not be far above its neutral level.\", \"Participants noted that the economic consequences of the COVID–19 pandemic were largely unforeseen at the time of the 2019–20 review and that the current economic environment differed greatly from the period leading up to that review, which was characterized in part by persistently low inflation and interest rates. In light of the experience of the past five years, participants assessed that it was important to consider potential revisions to the statement, with particular attention to some of the elements introduced in 2020. Participants highlighted as areas of consideration the statement's focus on the risks to the economy posed by the ELB, the approach of mitigating shortfalls from maximum employment, and the approach of aiming to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent following periods of persistently below-target inflation. Participants emphasized the need for the FOMC's monetary policy framework to be robust to a wide range of economic circumstances. They noted that economic uncertainty—including about the values of the longer-run neutral policy rate, the economy's potential growth rate, and the level of maximum employment—would remain an important factor affecting their decisionmaking. Participants also mentioned aspects of the statement that they thought should continue to be emphasized—including the Committee's firm commitment to achieving maximum employment and 2 percent inflation, as well as the importance of keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.\", 'day of January 2025.', 'The information available at the time of the meeting indicated that consumer price inflation remained somewhat elevated.

Participants noted that monetary policy would be informed by a wide range of incoming data, the economic outlook, and the balance of risks. Most participants assessed that some reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate this year would likely be appropriate, noting that upward pressure on inflation from tariffs may be temporary or modest, that medium- and longer-term inflation expectations had remained well anchored, or that some weakening of economic activity and labor market conditions could occur. A couple of participants noted that, if the data evolve in line with their expectations, they would be open to considering a reduction in the target range for the policy rate as soon as at the next meeting. Some participants saw the most likely appropriate path of monetary policy as involving no reductions in the target range for the federal funds rate this year, noting that recent inflation readings had continued to exceed the Committee's 2 percent goal, that upside risks to inflation remained meaningful in light of factors such as elevated short-term inflation expectations of businesses and households, or that they expected that the economy would remain resilient.

These factors, on net, resulted in some paring back of investors' perception of downside risk to growth and upside risk to inflation. Results from the Open Market Desk's Survey of Market Expectations were consistent with this interpretation: The median respondent's expectations for real gross domestic product (GDP) growth and personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation for 2025 retraced some of the moves that occurred after the April tariff announcements, though growth expectations were still materially lower and inflation expectations remained higher relative to the March survey.\", \"In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2025 through 2027 and over the longer run.

Participants indicated that, provided the economy remained near maximum employment, they would want to see further progress on inflation before making additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate. Participants noted that policy decisions were not on a preset course and were conditional on the evolution of the economy, the economic outlook, and the balance of risks.', \"With regard to the outlook for inflation, participants expected that, under appropriate monetary policy, inflation would continue to move toward 2 percent, although progress could remain uneven. Participants cited various factors as likely to put continuing downward pressure on inflation, including an easing in nominal wage growth, well-anchored longer-term inflation expectations, waning business pricing power, and the Committee's still-restrictive monetary policy stance. A few noted, however, that the current target range for the federal funds rate may not be far above its neutral level. Furthermore, some participants commented that with supply and demand in the labor market roughly in balance and in light of recent productivity gains, labor market conditions were unlikely to be a source of inflationary pressure in the near future. However, other factors were cited as having the potential to hinder the disinflation process, including the effects of potential changes in trade and immigration policy as well as strong consumer demand. Business contacts in a number of Districts had indicated that firms would attempt to pass on to consumers higher input costs arising from potential tariffs. In addition, some participants noted that some market- or survey-based measures of expected inflation had increased recently, although many participants emphasized that longer-term measures of expected inflation had remained well anchored. Some participants remarked that reported inflation at the beginning of the year was harder than usual to interpret because of the difficulties in fully removing seasonal effects, and a couple of participants commented that any increase in reported inflation in the first quarter due to such difficulties would imply a corresponding decrease in reported inflation in other quarters of the year.\", 'In considering the likelihood of various scenarios, participants agreed that the risks of higher inflation and weaker labor market conditions had diminished but remained elevated, citing a lower expected path of tariffs, encouraging recent readings on inflation and inflation expectations, resilience in consumer and business spending, or improvements in some measures of consumer or business sentiment. Some participants commented that they saw the risk of elevated inflation as remaining more prominent, or as having diminished by less, than risks to employment. A few participants saw risks to the labor market as having become predominant. They noted some recent signs of weakening in real activity or the labor market, or commented that conditions could weaken in the future, particularly if policy were to remain restrictive. Participants agreed that although uncertainty about inflation and the economic outlook had decreased, it remained appropriate to take a careful approach in adjusting monetary policy. Participants emphasized the importance of ensuring that longer-term inflation expectations remained well anchored and agreed that the current stance of monetary policy positioned the Committee well to respond in a timely way to potential economic developments.', \"Participants observed that inflation had eased significantly since its peak in 2022 but remained somewhat elevated relative to the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal. Participants noted that progress on disinflation had been uneven recently, with elevated monthly readings in January and February having been followed by a relatively low reading in March. With regard to the outlook for inflation, participants judged that it was likely to be boosted by the effects of higher tariffs, although significant uncertainty surrounded those effects. Many participants remarked that reports from their business contacts or surveys indicated that firms generally were planning to either partially or fully pass on tariff-related cost increases to consumers. Several participants noted that firms not directly subject to tariffs might take the opportunity to increase their prices if other prices rise. Some participants assessed that the recent increase in short-term inflation expectations, as indicated by various survey- and market-based measures, or the fact that the economy had gone through a period of high inflation recently could make firms more willing to raise prices. While most indicators had suggested that longer-term inflation expectations remained well anchored, some participants saw the risk that they could drift upward, which could put additional upward pressure on inflation. Some participants assessed that tariffs on intermediate goods could contribute to a more persistent increase in inflation. A few participants noted that supply chain disruptions caused by tariffs also could have persistent effects on inflation, reminiscent of such effects during the pandemic. Several participants highlighted factors that might help mitigate the magnitude and persistence of potential increases in inflation, such as reductions of tariff increases from ongoing trade negotiations, less tolerance for price increases by households, a weakening of the economy, reduced housing inflation pressures from lower immigration, or a desire by some firms to increase market share rather than raise prices on items not affected by tariffs.\", 'In their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that although swings in net exports had affected the data, recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace. Members agreed that the unemployment rate had remained at a low level and that labor market conditions had remained solid. Members concurred that inflation remained somewhat elevated. Members agreed that it was appropriate to acknowledge in the postmeeting statement that uncertainty about the economic outlook had diminished but remained elevated, and the Committee was attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate. The assessment that uncertainty had declined reflected, in part, a reduction in the expected level of tariffs, which appeared to peak in April and had subsequently declined.', 'The European Central Bank, the Bank of Mexico, and several central banks in emerging Asia eased monetary policy, citing in part the prospective drag on domestic growth from U.S. tariffs. In their communications, foreign central banks also emphasized the need to maintain policy flexibility amid heightened uncertainty.', 'A joint meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System was held in the offices of the Board of Governors on Tuesday, June 17, 2025, at 9:00 a.m. and continued on Wednesday, June 18, 2025, at 9:00 a.m.1', \"The median respondent's modal path for the federal funds rate in the June survey shifted higher through 2026 and implied two 25 basis point rate cuts both this year and next year. Market-based policy expectations were largely consistent with survey results, with both the futures-based average federal funds rate path and the options-based modal federal funds rate path shifting higher over the intermeeting period. Overall, the changes in the intermeeting period brought policy expectations for the next few quarters back close to where they stood at the time of the March FOMC meeting. However, futures-based policy expectations beyond the next few quarters had not fully retraced the decline seen over the previous intermeeting period, suggesting that perceived medium- and longer-term downside risks to growth remained larger than before the April tariff announcements. Nominal Treasury yields rose 15 to 20 basis points, on net, over the intermeeting period. The manager observed that the rise in shorter-maturity yields was consistent with the upward shift in the expected policy rate path. The rise in longer-maturity yields appeared to reflect, in part, market participants' increasing fiscal concerns: In response to a Desk survey question about the top factors behind the respondents' forecast of the 10-year yield over the next two years, the fiscal outlook was the factor cited by the largest number of respondents.\", 'Various participants discussed risks that, if realized, would have the potential to affect the appropriate path of monetary policy. Regarding upside risks to inflation, participants noted that, if the imposition of tariffs were to generate a larger-than-expected increase in inflation, if such an increase in inflation were to be more persistent than anticipated, or if a notable increase in medium- or longer-term inflation expectations were to occur, then it would be appropriate to maintain a more restrictive stance of monetary policy than would otherwise be the case, especially if labor market conditions and economic activity remained solid. By contrast, if labor market conditions or economic activity were to weaken materially, or if inflation were to continue to come down and inflation expectations remained well anchored, then it would be appropriate to establish a less restrictive stance of monetary policy than would otherwise be the case. Participants noted that the Committee might face difficult tradeoffs if elevated inflation proved to be more persistent while the outlook for employment weakened. If that were to occur, participants agreed that they would consider how far the economy is from each goal and the potentially different time horizons over which those respective gaps would be anticipated to close.', 'Participants viewed the statement as having played an important role in building a common understanding among policymakers of the congressionally mandated monetary policy goals and of their monetary policy strategy. The statement and other means of policy communication also figured importantly in conveying that understanding to the public and helping to anchor inflation expectations, thereby supporting the effective transmission of monetary policy. Participants indicated that they were looking forward to their discussions at upcoming meetings and to hearing a range of perspectives at various Fed Listens events as well as at a planned research conference, and that they were approaching the review with open minds.', \"In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants noted that inflation remained somewhat elevated. Participants also observed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace, that the unemployment rate had stabilized at a low level, and that labor market conditions had remained solid in recent months. With the stance of policy significantly less restrictive than it had been before the Committee's policy easing over its previous three meetings, all participants viewed it as appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. Participants judged that it was appropriate to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve's securities holdings.\", 'Participants noted that the available data showed that economic growth was solid and the unemployment rate was low. Participants observed that inflation had come down but remained somewhat elevated. Growth in consumer spending and business investment had been solid, though many participants observed that measures of household and business sentiment remained weak. Participants judged that uncertainty about the outlook was elevated amid evolving developments in trade policy, other government policies, and geopolitical risks, but that overall uncertainty had diminished since the previous meeting. Some participants commented that high uncertainty had the potential to restrain economic activity, including private-sector hiring, in the near term. Participants judged that there were downside risks to employment and economic activity and upside risks to inflation, but that these risks had decreased as expectations about effective tariff rates and their effects had declined from levels in April.', \"Committee participants continued their discussions related to their review of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy framework, with a focus on issues related to assessing the risks and uncertainty that are relevant for monetary policy and the potential implications of these issues for the FOMC's policy strategy and communications. The staff reviewed qualitative and quantitative tools that are commonly used to measure uncertainty about the economic outlook and the balance of risks, drawing on U.S. and international experience. The staff then discussed monetary policy strategies that aim to be robust to a variety of economic environments and ways in which risk-management considerations can be incorporated into monetary policy analysis and decisionmaking.

Almost all participants supported a slowing of the pace of runoff at this meeting. Most participants noted the importance of clearly communicating that slowing the runoff pace had no implications for the stance of monetary policy, would not affect the long-term path of the balance sheet, was a natural progression of the slowing decided at the May 2024 meeting, and was in line with the Committee's principles and plans for balance sheet reduction announced in 2022. Some participants noted that a slower pace of runoff would also help guard against reserve scarcity emerging with little advance notice during a period of potentially rapid increase in the TGA. Several participants did not see a compelling case for slowing the pace of runoff at this meeting. A number of participants commented that the Committee's existing tools could also be used to help address potential disruptions to the market for reserves. Some participants highlighted the importance of the Federal Reserve's ceiling tools and encouraged the ongoing efforts of the Desk to improve the efficacy of the standing repo facility. Several participants observed that the Federal Reserve's traditional tool of open market operations could also be used should signs of reserve scarcity unexpectedly emerge. Many participants expressed interest in continued discussion of technical aspects of balance sheet policy and tools after the framework review is completed.\", \"Despite the volatility in broader markets over the intermeeting period, money market functioning had remained orderly. Rates on Treasury repurchase agreements (repo) were somewhat higher, on average, over the period, but there had been no significant strains in that market. A range of core indicators continued to suggest that reserves remained abundant. The manager noted some movement in one of the Desk's indicators arising from a modest increase in federal funds borrowing by some domestic banks in the second half of April; however, that development appeared related to tax flows and was not indicative of tighter reserves conditions. The manager observed that reserves stood above $3.2 trillion and were expected to increase as the Treasury General Account (TGA) declined until resolution of the debt limit situation. Take-up at the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility had increased but remained low in absolute terms. Following the FOMC's decision to slow the pace of balance sheet runoff at its March meeting, respondents to the Survey of Market Expectations moved their expected date for the end of balance sheet runoff back, on average, to January 2026 and slightly lowered their estimates for the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet at the time that runoff stopped.\", 'The manager also discussed the trajectory of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) portfolio. Since balance sheet runoff commenced in June 2022, SOMA securities holdings had fallen almost $2-1/4 trillion. As a percentage of GDP, the portfolio had declined to close to where it had been at the start of the pandemic. The corresponding drain in Federal Reserve liabilities had largely come out of balances at the ON RRP facility, while reserve levels had been relatively little changed over that period. Respondents to the June Desk survey, on average, expected runoff to end in February of next year, a month later compared with the previous survey, with an expected size of the SOMA portfolio of $6.2 trillion, or about 20 percent of GDP. At that point, the respondents, on average, expected reserves to be at $2.9 trillion and the ON RRP balance to be low.', \"The manager observed that the ON RRP facility had reached a post-2021 low of under $59 billion in mid-February. Abstracting from the debt limit situation, with the ON RRP facility nearly depleted, portfolio runoff was likely to translate to lower reserves in the future. Several indicators of reserve conditions continued to point to reserves remaining abundant, but the reliability of the signals provided by those indicators was starting to be impaired by the debt limit situation, which was already affecting the Federal Reserve's liabilities. The Treasury General Account (TGA) had declined nearly $300 billion since the debt issuance suspension period was declared in January. As a result, reserves were about $180 billion higher; ON RRP balances had also increased somewhat. Reserves were likely to continue to grow, except for periods around tax dates, until a resolution of the debt limit situation and then drop quickly as the TGA is rebuilt. In that scenario, reserves could potentially reach levels below those viewed by the Committee as appropriate without market indicators being able to provide much advance warning. The manager noted that either pausing or sufficiently slowing runoff would provide meaningful insurance against that possibility.\", \"A number of participants also discussed some issues related to the balance sheet. Regarding the composition of secondary-market purchases of Treasury securities that would occur once the process of reducing the size of the Federal Reserve's holdings of securities had come to an end, many participants expressed the view that it would be appropriate to structure purchases in a way that moved the maturity composition of the SOMA portfolio closer to that of the outstanding stock of Treasury debt while also minimizing the risk of disruptions to the market. Regarding the potential for significant swings in reserves over coming months related to debt ceiling dynamics, various participants noted that it may be appropriate to consider pausing or slowing balance sheet runoff until the resolution of this event. Several participants also expressed support for the Desk's future consideration of possible ways to improve the efficacy of the SRF.\", \"Next, the deputy manager briefed policymakers on possible alternative strategies that the Committee might follow with regard to purchases of Treasury securities in the secondary market after the eventual conclusion of the process of balance sheet runoff. These strategies would further implement the policy laid out in the Committee's Principles and Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet. The briefing outlined a few illustrative scenarios; under each scenario, principal payments received from agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities (MBS) holdings would be directed toward Treasury securities via secondary-market purchases. The scenarios presented corresponded to different trajectories of the holdings of Treasury securities in the SOMA. Under all scenarios considered, the maturity composition of Treasury holdings in the SOMA portfolio moved into closer alignment with the maturity composition of the outstanding stock of Treasury securities. The scenarios differed on how quickly this alignment would be achieved and, correspondingly, on the assumed increase over coming years in the share of Treasury bills held in the SOMA portfolio.\", \"More generally, the manager also noted that slowing runoff would also be an effective way—consistent with the Committee's plans—of addressing the risks posed by a continued tightening of repo market conditions and a nearly depleted ON RRP facility. Desk survey results indicated that more than half of the respondents expected the Committee to either pause or slow runoff as its next move, with a majority of those leaning toward a slowdown. Many respondents also expected the System Open Market Account (SOMA) portfolio to consist, in the long run, of Treasury securities only and to match the maturity composition of Treasury debt outstanding.\", 'The manager turned next to money markets and Desk operations. Unsecured overnight rates remained stable over the intermeeting period. Rates in the repurchase agreement (repo) market were softer relative to the previous intermeeting period, including at the May month-end, as reductions in net Treasury bill issuance amid the ongoing debt limit situation resulted in increased demand for repo. With the softness in repo making the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility more attractive on a relative basis, usage of the ON RRP facility had been broadly stable, except for the typical spike at month-end. Since the start of the debt issuance suspension period in January, the Treasury General Account (TGA) had declined nearly $420 billion, ON RRP balances had increased about $75 billion, and reserves had increased $150 billion. Key indicators continued to suggest that reserves, which stood at nearly $3.5 trillion, were well into the abundant range. Once the debt limit was addressed, however, the TGA was likely to be rebuilt fairly quickly, which would drain liquidity from the system and result in fast declines in both ON RRP and reserve balances.', 'A joint meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System was held in the offices of the Board of Governors on Tuesday, March 18, 2025, at 9:00 a.m. and continued on Wednesday, March 19, 2025, at 9:00 a.m.1', \"The manager turned first to a review of developments in financial markets. Over the intermeeting period, broad equity price indexes had declined moderately, credit spreads had remained very tight, and the trade-weighted value of the dollar had risen slightly. In considering the expected path of the federal funds rate, the manager noted that the modal policy rate path implied by options prices had not changed appreciably on net over the intermeeting period and was broadly consistent with a single quarter-point lowering of the target range for the federal funds rate taking place during 2025. The average rate path implied by futures prices was also little changed and was above the corresponding median rates in the December 2024 Summary of Economic Projections. The modal path implied by the Open Market Desk's Survey of Market Expectations shifted up somewhat over the intermeeting period, with respondents generally judging that policy rate reductions would occur later than previously assessed, and was broadly consistent with market-implied paths at horizons up to early 2026. Beyond that period, however, the survey-based path was notably below the market-implied path. This discrepancy likely partly reflected positive market risk premiums as well as survey biases. In their expectations of Federal Reserve balance sheet policy, survey respondents on average saw the process of runoff concluding by mid-2025, slightly later than they had previously expected.\", 'Conditions in U.S. short-term funding markets remained stable. After increasing over the previous intermeeting period because of incoming tax receipts, the TGA had resumed its decline in response to actions associated with the ongoing federal debt limit situation. Average usage of the ON RRP facility was little changed. Rates in secured markets were, on average, slightly below the effective federal funds rate, likely reflecting low Treasury bill supply.', 'In their discussion of financial stability, participants who commented noted vulnerabilities to the financial system that they assessed warranted monitoring. Some participants discussed the heightened volatility seen across a range of asset markets over the first half of April, noting that markets had continued to function and were able to accommodate a surge in trading volumes despite lower measures of liquidity. Several participants observed that resilience in the Treasury market was of special importance and had been a focus of attention for a number of years. Some participants commented on a change from the typical pattern of correlations across asset prices during the first half of April, with longer-term Treasury yields rising and the dollar depreciating despite the decline in the prices of equities and other risky assets. These participants noted that a durable shift in such correlations or a diminution of the perceived safe-haven status of U.S. assets could have long-lasting implications for the economy. While noting that asset prices had declined somewhat, several participants observed that downside risks to the outlook had increased, leading them to question whether asset prices had actually gotten closer to fundamental valuations. Some participants mentioned high levels of leverage at hedge funds or potential concerns about private credit and equity. While judging that balance sheet conditions for households, nonfinancial businesses, and banks appeared to be solid, several participants noted that an economic downturn or higher interest rates could lead to a deterioration in those conditions. A few participants commented that central clearing of the SRF could encourage its use during times of market stress, which would help alleviate such stresses.', 'Conditions in U.S. short-term funding markets remained orderly. While the TGA increased in the latter part of the period because of incoming tax receipts, it was expected to resume its decline. This dynamic, if realized, will boost the sum of ON RRP take-up and reserve balances until the resolution of the federal debt limit situation and will tend to put downward pressure on short-term market rates.', \"The Committee voted unanimously to renew the dollar and foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank. In addition, the Committee voted unanimously to renew the reciprocal currency arrangements with the Bank of Canada and the Bank of Mexico; these arrangements are associated with the Federal Reserve's participation in the North American Framework Agreement of 1994. The votes to renew the Federal Reserve's participation in these standing arrangements occur annually at the April or May FOMC meeting.\", 'Conditions in U.S. short-term funding markets remained orderly. Secured market rates increased early in the period, retracing the decline following the technical adjustment in the ON RRP rate in December, before declining later in the period. Treasury bill supply began contracting in late February and was expected to decline further until the resolution of the federal debt limit situation. The accompanying drawdown in the TGA was expected to boost ON RRP take-up and reserves, putting downward pressure on secured market rates; early signs of these dynamics were evident over the latter half of the period.', 'A joint meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System was held in the offices of the Board of Governors on Tuesday, May 6, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. and continued on Wednesday, May 7, 2025, at 9:00 a.m.1', 'The manager observed that usage of the ON RRP facility increased as expected at year-end but had declined on net over the intermeeting period. The manager also noted that a range of indicators continued to suggest that reserves had remained abundant over the intermeeting period. However, the manager cautioned that the debt limit situation may cloud the signals provided by the indicators. In addition, reserves might decline quickly upon resolution of the debt limit and, at the current pace of balance sheet runoff, might potentially reach levels below those viewed by the Committee as appropriate.', 'A joint meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System was held in the offices of the Board of Governors on January 28, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. and continued on Wednesday, January 29, 2025, at 9:00 a.m.1', \"Consistent with the Committee's decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to maintain the interest rate paid on reserve balances at 4.4 percent, effective June 20, 2025. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to approve the establishment of the primary credit rate at the existing level of 4.5 percent.\", 'A joint meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System was held in the offices of the Board of Governors on Tuesday, June 17, 2025, at 9:00 a.m. and continued on Wednesday, June 18, 2025, at 9:00 a.m.1', 'The manager turned next to money market developments. Unsecured overnight rates remained stable over the intermeeting period, while rates in the repurchase agreement (repo) market varied notably, and some indicators suggested that conditions in that market had continued to tighten. The pass-through to repo rates of the 5 basis point technical adjustment to the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) rate made in December appeared to have dissipated in February, even though repo rates had declined in mid-March as a result of a drop in bill issuance associated with the debt limit situation. Furthermore, the sensitivity of repo rates in the client-to-dealer segment to changes in transaction volumes had diminished relative to the spike observed at year-end but remained at levels above those that prevailed in late 2024. The sensitivity of repo rates to Treasury bill issuance had also increased in recent months. The manager interpreted these developments more as signs of continued normalization of the repo market than as a concern, but he also noted that, in the past, a tightening of the repo market had been a precursor to tighter reserve conditions.', \"In support of its goals, the Committee agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. Members agreed that in considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. Members agreed to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency MBS. All members agreed that the postmeeting statement should affirm their strong commitment both to supporting maximum employment and to returning inflation to the Committee's 2 percent objective.\", \"In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants noted that inflation remained somewhat elevated. Participants also observed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace, although swings in net exports and inventories had affected the measurement and interpretation of the data. Participants further noted that the unemployment rate remained at a low level and that labor market conditions had remained solid. Participants observed that uncertainty about the economic outlook had diminished amid a reduction in announced and expected tariffs, which appeared to peak in April and had subsequently declined, but that overall uncertainty continued to be elevated. All participants viewed it as appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent.

Over the intermeeting period, policy expectations and Treasury yields rose modestly, credit spreads narrowed, and equity prices increased. Markets were attentive to the de-escalation of trade tensions; generally weaker-than-expected economic data releases, with the notable exception of the May employment report; and prospects for fiscal expansion. These factors, on net, resulted in some paring back of investors' perception of downside risk to growth and upside risk to inflation. Results from the Open Market Desk's Survey of Market Expectations were consistent with this interpretation: The median respondent's expectations for real gross domestic product (GDP) growth and personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation for 2025 retraced some of the moves that occurred after the April tariff announcements, though growth expectations were still materially lower and inflation expectations remained higher relative to the March survey.\", 'Tariff announcements led to a significant deterioration in global risk sentiment, which largely reversed following a subsequent pause of some of the tariffs and growing investor optimism about easing of trade tensions. On net, foreign equity prices moved down somewhat, while corporate bond spreads widened moderately. Market-based policy expectations and near-term inflation compensation declined notably in Europe. The dollar depreciated against many advanced foreign economy (AFE) currencies despite widening U.S.–AFE yield differentials. Market participants generally attributed dollar weakness to concerns about potential adverse effects of trade policy on the U.S. growth outlook.', 'International trade flows continued to be volatile amid substantial shifts in U.S. tariffs. After surging in the first quarter ahead of expected tariff hikes, U.S. imports—especially of consumer goods—declined sharply in April. That decline suggested that the front-loading of imports had stopped after the introduction of broad-based tariffs in early April. By contrast, U.S. exports firmed in April. In mid-May, the U.S. and China agreed to a 90-day reduction in bilateral tariffs, and recent indicators suggested that this change led to a rebound in trade flows.', 'Over the intermeeting period, the market-implied path of the federal funds rate over the next few meetings edged up, on net, but declined somewhat toward the end of the year, as the announcements on new U.S. tariffs left investors more concerned about the near-term outlooks for both inflation and growth. Near-term inflation compensation rose notably, while longer-term inflation compensation appeared to remain well anchored. Against the backdrop of heightened volatility, yields on shorter- and medium-term nominal Treasury securities declined, but longer-term rates rose somewhat. The increase in longer-term yields appeared to be partly attributable to higher term premiums.', 'Foreign financial markets were affected by investor concerns about global economic growth, in part related to higher tariffs, while expectations for greater fiscal spending in some economies provided an offsetting effect. On balance, longer-term yields and equity indexes increased in most major foreign economies. Tariff-related developments led to significant volatility in FX markets, and the exchange value of the dollar declined, on net, as investor optimism regarding the relative strength of the U.S. economy seemed to have diminished.', \"The manager turned first to a review of financial market developments. Amid significant market volatility over the intermeeting period, longer-maturity Treasury yields rose, broad equity price indexes changed little on net, credit spreads widened, and the dollar depreciated. The manager observed that market participants appeared to interpret recently announced trade policy changes as a negative supply shock that could restrain domestic activity relative to foreign activity in the near term. The manager noted that respondents to the Open Market Desk's Survey of Market Expectations had materially lowered their gross domestic product (GDP) forecasts and raised their inflation forecasts for this year while significantly increasing the probability they placed on a recession occurring within the next six months.\", \"In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants noted that inflation remained somewhat elevated. Participants also observed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace, although swings in net exports and inventories had affected the measurement and interpretation of the data. Participants further noted that the unemployment rate remained at a low level and that labor market conditions had remained solid. Participants observed that uncertainty about the economic outlook had diminished amid a reduction in announced and expected tariffs, which appeared to peak in April and had subsequently declined, but that overall uncertainty continued to be elevated. All participants viewed it as appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. Participants judged it appropriate to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve's securities holdings.\", 'With regard to the outlook for inflation, participants judged that inflation was likely to be boosted this year by the effects of higher tariffs, although significant uncertainty surrounded the magnitude and persistence of such effects. Several participants noted that the announced or planned tariff increases were larger and broader than many of their business contacts had expected. Several participants also noted that their contacts were already reporting increases in costs, possibly in anticipation of rising tariffs, or that their contacts had indicated willingness to pass on to consumers higher input costs that would arise from potential tariff increases. A couple of participants highlighted factors that might limit the inflationary effects of tariffs, noting that many households had depleted the excess savings they had accumulated during the pandemic and were less likely to accept additional price increases, or that stricter immigration policies might reduce demand for rental and affordable housing and alleviate upward pressures on housing inflation. A couple of participants noted that the continued balance in the labor market suggested that labor market conditions were unlikely to be a source of inflationary pressure. A couple of participants noted that, in the period ahead, it could be especially difficult to distinguish between relatively persistent changes in inflation and more temporary changes that might be associated with the introduction of tariffs. Participants commented on a range of factors that could influence the persistence of tariff effects, including the extent to which tariffs are imposed on intermediate goods and thus affect input costs at various stages of production, the extent to which complex supply chains need to be restructured, the actions of trading partners in responding with retaliatory increases in tariffs, and the stability of longer-term inflation expectations.', \"The staff's inflation projection was lower than the one prepared for the May meeting. Tariff increases were expected to raise inflation this year and to provide a small boost in 2026. Inflation was projected to decline to 2 percent by 2027.\", \"The median respondent's modal path for the federal funds rate in the June survey shifted higher through 2026 and implied two 25 basis point rate cuts both this year and next year. Market-based policy expectations were largely consistent with survey results, with both the futures-based average federal funds rate path and the options-based modal federal funds rate path shifting higher over the intermeeting period. Overall, the changes in the intermeeting period brought policy expectations for the next few quarters back close to where they stood at the time of the March FOMC meeting. However, futures-based policy expectations beyond the next few quarters had not fully retraced the decline seen over the previous intermeeting period, suggesting that perceived medium- and longer-term downside risks to growth remained larger than before the April tariff announcements. Nominal Treasury yields rose 15 to 20 basis points, on net, over the intermeeting period. The manager observed that the rise in shorter-maturity yields was consistent with the upward shift in the expected policy rate path. The rise in longer-maturity yields appeared to reflect, in part, market participants' increasing fiscal concerns: In response to a Desk survey question about the top factors behind the respondents' forecast of the 10-year yield over the next two years, the fiscal outlook was the factor cited by the largest number of respondents.\", 'The manager turned first to a review of financial market developments. Over the intermeeting period, Treasury yields declined, equity prices fell, credit spreads widened, and the dollar depreciated. These moves appeared to reflect increased perceived risks—rather than a base case—of a significant deterioration of the U.S. outlook, as investors responded to both weaker-than-expected consumer spending and sentiment data as well as to developments in trade policy that had raised uncertainty.', 'Foreign financial market moves over the intermeeting period mainly reflected developments in the U.S., including trade policy news and the relative strength of the U.S. economic data releases during the period. The broad dollar index increased slightly on net. Longer-term AFE yields edged higher, reflecting in part spillovers from higher U.S. yields. Stock price indexes increased in most foreign countries, with the notable exception of China, in which equity prices declined moderately, in part reflecting weaker-than-expected forward-looking manufacturing indicators. Capital outflows from emerging markets continued, and several EME central banks drew down their foreign exchange reserves, including their holdings of U.S. Treasury securities, to resist currency depreciation pressures.', 'international partners and customers. The volatility of U.S. tariffs has triggered economic', 'With regard to the business sector, most participants commented that contacts or surveys reported increased uncertainty about potential changes in federal government policies and a deterioration in business sentiment, which had led many firms to pause their capital spending plans. Several participants highlighted that the auto industry faced significant risks associated with tariffs because of its interconnected and cross-border supply chains. By contrast, several participants noted that their contacts expressed optimism about future firm profitability driven by more business-friendly regulatory or fiscal policy changes or expected productivity gains from artificial intelligence and related technologies. A few participants highlighted the strains faced by the agricultural sector, as tariffs threatened to further compress its profit margins by lowering farm export prices and raising input costs.', 'as a result of the trade dispute with the United States, including any tariffs implemented by the', \"Participants observed that inflation had eased significantly since its peak in 2022 but remained somewhat elevated relative to the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal. Participants noted that progress on disinflation had been uneven recently, with elevated monthly readings in January and February having been followed by a relatively low reading in March. With regard to the outlook for inflation, participants judged that it was likely to be boosted by the effects of higher tariffs, although significant uncertainty surrounded those effects. Many participants remarked that reports from their business contacts or surveys indicated that firms generally were planning to either partially or fully pass on tariff-related cost increases to consumers. Several participants noted that firms not directly subject to tariffs might take the opportunity to increase their prices if other prices rise. Some participants assessed that the recent increase in short-term inflation expectations, as indicated by various survey- and market-based measures, or the fact that the economy had gone through a period of high inflation recently could make firms more willing to raise prices. While most indicators had suggested that longer-term inflation expectations remained well anchored, some participants saw the risk that they could drift upward, which could put additional upward pressure on inflation. Some participants assessed that tariffs on intermediate goods could contribute to a more persistent increase in inflation. A few participants noted that supply chain disruptions caused by tariffs also could have persistent effects on inflation, reminiscent of such effects during the pandemic. Several participants highlighted factors that might help mitigate the magnitude and persistence of potential increases in inflation, such as reductions of tariff increases from ongoing trade negotiations, less tolerance for price increases by households, a weakening of the economy, reduced housing inflation pressures from lower immigration, or a desire by some firms to increase market share rather than raise prices on items not affected by tariffs.\", 'The European Central Bank, the Bank of Mexico, and several central banks in emerging Asia eased monetary policy, citing in part the prospective drag on domestic growth from U.S. tariffs. In their communications, foreign central banks also emphasized the need to maintain policy flexibility amid heightened uncertainty.', 'Asset price dynamics abroad were opposite to those in the U.S. Major foreign equity indexes, including those of the euro area and China, appreciated notably over the intermeeting period, while sovereign yields increased in many jurisdictions. The dollar depreciated against most major currencies, although currencies perceived as more sensitive to higher U.S. tariff rates, such as the Canadian dollar and those in emerging Asia, were relatively little changed. Overall, market participants characterized price action across global equities, global rates, and foreign exchange (FX) as consistent with some re-allocation away from trades that had been based on expectations for continued U.S. economic outperformance relative to global peers.', 'In their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that although swings in net exports had affected the data, recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace. Members agreed that the unemployment rate had remained at a low level and that labor market conditions had remained solid. Members concurred that inflation remained somewhat elevated. Members agreed that it was appropriate to acknowledge in the postmeeting statement that uncertainty about the economic outlook had diminished but remained elevated, and the Committee was attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate. The assessment that uncertainty had declined reflected, in part, a reduction in the expected level of tariffs, which appeared to peak in April and had subsequently declined.', \"The manager turned first to a review of developments in financial markets. Over the intermeeting period, broad equity price indexes had declined moderately, credit spreads had remained very tight, and the trade-weighted value of the dollar had risen slightly. In considering the expected path of the federal funds rate, the manager noted that the modal policy rate path implied by options prices had not changed appreciably on net over the intermeeting period and was broadly consistent with a single quarter-point lowering of the target range for the federal funds rate taking place during 2025. The average rate path implied by futures prices was also little changed and was above the corresponding median rates in the December 2024 Summary of Economic Projections. The modal path implied by the Open Market Desk's Survey of Market Expectations shifted up somewhat over the intermeeting period, with respondents generally judging that policy rate reductions would occur later than previously assessed, and was broadly consistent with market-implied paths at horizons up to early 2026. Beyond that period, however, the survey-based path was notably below the market-implied path. This discrepancy likely partly reflected positive market risk premiums as well as survey biases. In their expectations of Federal Reserve balance sheet policy, survey respondents on average saw the process of runoff concluding by mid-2025, slightly later than they had previously expected.\", 'Hi. Thank you for taking my question. How do you guys see the potential tariff impact to your product or consumer demand under Trump 2.0? You guys did fine under Trump 1.0.', \"The staff projection of real GDP growth for this year through 2027 was higher than the one prepared for the May meeting, primarily because trade policy announcements led the staff to reduce their assumptions about effective tariff rates relative to those in their previous forecast. With that improved economic outlook, labor market conditions were not expected to weaken as much as in the previous projection, though the unemployment rate was still forecast to rise somewhat through next year and to run a little above the staff's estimate of its natural rate through 2027.\", \"Committee participants continued their discussions related to their review of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy framework, with a focus on the price-stability side of the dual mandate and the FOMC's monetary policy strategy. The staff briefed policymakers on lessons drawn from the experiences of the U.S. and other economies with inflation over the past five years and the possible implications for monetary policy. The staff discussed the role of large and persistent demand and supply shifts, the way production capacity constraints amplified supply–demand imbalances, and the degree to which labor market tightness contributed to inflation both in the U.S. and abroad.\", 'Participants observed that, even though swings in net exports had affected the data, the available data indicated that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace and labor market conditions continued to be solid, but inflation remained somewhat elevated. Participants assessed that the tariff increases announced so far had been significantly larger and broader than they had anticipated. Participants observed that there was considerable uncertainty surrounding the evolution of trade policy as well as about the scale, scope, timing, and persistence of associated economic effects. Significant uncertainties also surrounded changes in fiscal, regulatory, and immigration policies and their economic effects. Taken together, participants saw the uncertainty about their economic outlooks as unusually elevated. Overall, participants judged that downside risks to employment and economic activity and upside risks to inflation had risen, primarily reflecting the potential effects of tariff increases.', 'In discussing their outlooks for inflation, participants noted that increased tariffs were likely to put upward pressure on prices. There was considerable uncertainty, however, about the timing, size, and duration of these effects. Many observed that it might take some time for the effect of higher tariffs to be reflected in the prices of final goods because firms might choose not to raise prices on affected goods and services until they had run down inventories of products imported before the increase in tariffs or because it would take some time for tariffs on intermediate goods to work through the supply chain. Several participants commented that upward pressure on prices could be greater if tariffs disrupted supply chains or acted as a drag on productivity. Many participants noted that the eventual effect of tariffs on inflation could be more limited if trade deals are reached soon, if firms are able to quickly adjust their supply chains, or if firms can use other margins of adjustment to reduce their exposure to the effects of tariffs. Several participants noted that firms not directly subject to tariffs might take the opportunity to increase their prices if other prices rise, particularly those of complementary products. Participants relayed a range of assessments from their business contacts regarding the extent to which tariff-related cost increases would be passed on to consumers. Several participants observed that the pass-through of tariffs might be limited if households and businesses exhibit a low tolerance for price hikes or if firms seek to increase their market share as others raise their prices. A few participants noted that the pass-through of tariff-related costs likely would be greater for smaller businesses or businesses with narrow profit margins.']' to 'retrieved_answers'\n",

Participants noted that monetary policy would be informed by a wide range of incoming data, the economic outlook, and the balance of risks. Most participants assessed that some reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate this year would likely be appropriate, noting that upward pressure on inflation from tariffs may be temporary or modest, that medium- and longer-term inflation expectations had remained well anchored, or that some weakening of economic activity and labor market conditions could occur. A couple of participants noted that, if the data evolve in line with their expectations, they would be open to considering a reduction in the target range for the policy rate as soon as at the next meeting. Some participants saw the most likely appropriate path of monetary policy as involving no reductions in the target range for the federal funds rate this year, noting that recent inflation readings had continued to exceed the Committee's 2 percent goal, that upside risks to inflation remained meaningful in light of factors such as elevated short-term inflation expectations of businesses and households, or that they expected that the economy would remain resilient. Several participants commented that the current target range for the federal funds rate may not be far above its neutral level.\", \"Participants noted that the economic consequences of the COVID–19 pandemic were largely unforeseen at the time of the 2019–20 review and that the current economic environment differed greatly from the period leading up to that review, which was characterized in part by persistently low inflation and interest rates. In light of the experience of the past five years, participants assessed that it was important to consider potential revisions to the statement, with particular attention to some of the elements introduced in 2020. Participants highlighted as areas of consideration the statement's focus on the risks to the economy posed by the ELB, the approach of mitigating shortfalls from maximum employment, and the approach of aiming to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent following periods of persistently below-target inflation. Participants emphasized the need for the FOMC's monetary policy framework to be robust to a wide range of economic circumstances. They noted that economic uncertainty—including about the values of the longer-run neutral policy rate, the economy's potential growth rate, and the level of maximum employment—would remain an important factor affecting their decisionmaking. Participants also mentioned aspects of the statement that they thought should continue to be emphasized—including the Committee's firm commitment to achieving maximum employment and 2 percent inflation, as well as the importance of keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.\", \"Committee participants continued their discussions related to their review of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy framework, with a focus on labor market dynamics and the FOMC's maximum employment goal. The staff briefed policymakers on the concept of maximum employment and related labor market indicators. They discussed conceptual benchmarks used in evaluating the position of the labor market relative to maximum employment and in ascertaining the interaction of maximum employment and price stability. They discussed a set of core labor market indicators used to help assess maximum employment, including the unemployment rate, job vacancies, the employment-to-population (EPOP) ratio, and the labor force participation rate (LFPR), and described the use of these indicators in assessing maximum employment during the pandemic-related recession and subsequent economic recovery. The staff also presented model-based analysis of simple monetary policy rules that respond to deviations of inflation from 2 percent but differ on whether they respond to shortfalls or deviations from maximum employment.\", 'In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants noted that inflation remained somewhat elevated. Participants also observed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace, that the unemployment rate had stabilized at a low level, and that labor market conditions had remained solid in recent months.

Participants indicated that, provided the economy remained near maximum employment, they would want to see further progress on inflation before making additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate.

The substantial upward revision to the inflation forecast in 2025 was judged to leave the risks around the inflation projection balanced in that year. Thereafter, the staff continued to view the risks around the inflation forecast as skewed to the upside, with recent increases in some measures of inflation expectations raising the possibility that inflation would prove to be more persistent than the baseline projection assumed.', 'In discussing risk-management considerations that could bear on the outlook for monetary policy, participants assessed that uncertainty around the economic outlook had increased, with almost all participants viewing risks to inflation as tilted to the upside and risks to employment as tilted to the downside. Participants remarked that monetary policy was well positioned to address future developments; a restrictive policy could be maintained for longer if inflation were to remain elevated, and policy could be eased if labor market conditions were to deteriorate or economic activity were to weaken. Some participants observed, however, that the Committee may face difficult tradeoffs if inflation proved to be more persistent while the outlook for growth and employment weakened. Several participants emphasized that elevated inflation could prove to be more persistent than expected.', 'In considering the likelihood of various scenarios, participants agreed that the risks of higher inflation and weaker labor market conditions had diminished but remained elevated, citing a lower expected path of tariffs, encouraging recent readings on inflation and inflation expectations, resilience in consumer and business spending, or improvements in some measures of consumer or business sentiment. Some participants commented that they saw the risk of elevated inflation as remaining more prominent, or as having diminished by less, than risks to employment. A few participants saw risks to the labor market as having become predominant. They noted some recent signs of weakening in real activity or the labor market, or commented that conditions could weaken in the future, particularly if policy were to remain restrictive. Participants agreed that although uncertainty about inflation and the economic outlook had decreased, it remained appropriate to take a careful approach in adjusting monetary policy.

Some participants discussed the heightened volatility seen across a range of asset markets over the first half of April, noting that markets had continued to function and were able to accommodate a surge in trading volumes despite lower measures of liquidity. Several participants observed that resilience in the Treasury market was of special importance and had been a focus of attention for a number of years. Some participants commented on a change from the typical pattern of correlations across asset prices during the first half of April, with longer-term Treasury yields rising and the dollar depreciating despite the decline in the prices of equities and other risky assets. These participants noted that a durable shift in such correlations or a diminution of the perceived safe-haven status of U.S. assets could have long-lasting implications for the economy. While noting that asset prices had declined somewhat, several participants observed that downside risks to the outlook had increased, leading them to question whether asset prices had actually gotten closer to fundamental valuations. Some participants mentioned high levels of leverage at hedge funds or potential concerns about private credit and equity. While judging that balance sheet conditions for households, nonfinancial businesses, and banks appeared to be solid, several participants noted that an economic downturn or higher interest rates could lead to a deterioration in those conditions.

The option-implied distribution of rate outcomes around year-end shifted to the left and became more skewed to the downside. The market perception that risks to the policy rate tilted more to the downside accounts for the fact that the futures-based expected policy path shifted down more over the period and was consistent with around three rate cuts by year-end.

However, the survey pointed to increased disagreement across respondents as to the most likely path of policy.', \"The median respondent's modal path for the federal funds rate in the June survey shifted higher through 2026 and implied two 25 basis point rate cuts both this year and next year. Market-based policy expectations were largely consistent with survey results, with both the futures-based average federal funds rate path and the options-based modal federal funds rate path shifting higher over the intermeeting period. Overall, the changes in the intermeeting period brought policy expectations for the next few quarters back close to where they stood at the time of the March FOMC meeting. However, futures-based policy expectations beyond the next few quarters had not fully retraced the decline seen over the previous intermeeting period, suggesting that perceived medium- and longer-term downside risks to growth remained larger than before the April tariff announcements. Nominal Treasury yields rose 15 to 20 basis points, on net, over the intermeeting period. The manager observed that the rise in shorter-maturity yields was consistent with the upward shift in the expected policy rate path.

The modal path implied by the Open Market Desk's Survey of Market Expectations shifted up somewhat over the intermeeting period, with respondents generally judging that policy rate reductions would occur later than previously assessed, and was broadly consistent with market-implied paths at horizons up to early 2026. Beyond that period, however, the survey-based path was notably below the market-implied path. This discrepancy likely partly reflected positive market risk premiums as well as survey biases. In their expectations of Federal Reserve balance sheet policy, survey respondents on average saw the process of runoff concluding by mid-2025, slightly later than they had previously expected.\", \"The Committee voted unanimously to renew the dollar and foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank. In addition, the Committee voted unanimously to renew the reciprocal currency arrangements with the Bank of Canada and the Bank of Mexico; these arrangements are associated with the Federal Reserve's participation in the North American Framework Agreement of 1994. The votes to renew the Federal Reserve's participation in these standing arrangements occur annually at the April or May FOMC meeting.\", \"In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants noted that inflation remained somewhat elevated. Participants also observed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace, although swings in net exports and inventories had affected the measurement and interpretation of the data. Participants further noted that the unemployment rate remained at a low level and that labor market conditions had remained solid. Participants observed that uncertainty about the economic outlook had diminished amid a reduction in announced and expected tariffs, which appeared to peak in April and had subsequently declined, but that overall uncertainty continued to be elevated. All participants viewed it as appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent.

In light of the experience of the past five years, participants assessed that it was important to consider potential revisions to the statement, with particular attention to some of the elements introduced in 2020. Participants highlighted as areas of consideration the statement's focus on the risks to the economy posed by the ELB, the approach of mitigating shortfalls from maximum employment, and the approach of aiming to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent following periods of persistently below-target inflation. Participants emphasized the need for the FOMC's monetary policy framework to be robust to a wide range of economic circumstances. They noted that economic uncertainty—including about the values of the longer-run neutral policy rate, the economy's potential growth rate, and the level of maximum employment—would remain an important factor affecting their decisionmaking. Participants also mentioned aspects of the statement that they thought should continue to be emphasized—including the Committee's firm commitment to achieving maximum employment and 2 percent inflation, as well as the importance of keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.\", 'June 30, 2025 2024 2023 Federal statutory rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 % Effect of: Foreign earnings', \"In support of its goals, the Committee agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent.

Participants indicated that, provided the economy remained near maximum employment, they would want to see further progress on inflation before making additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate.

The staff briefed policymakers on the concept of maximum employment and related labor market indicators. They discussed conceptual benchmarks used in evaluating the position of the labor market relative to maximum employment and in ascertaining the interaction of maximum employment and price stability. They discussed a set of core labor market indicators used to help assess maximum employment, including the unemployment rate, job vacancies, the employment-to-population (EPOP) ratio, and the labor force participation rate (LFPR), and described the use of these indicators in assessing maximum employment during the pandemic-related recession and subsequent economic recovery. The staff also presented model-based analysis of simple monetary policy rules that respond to deviations of inflation from 2 percent but differ on whether they respond to shortfalls or deviations from maximum employment.\", \"Participants assessed that balance sheet reduction had gone well thus far. All participants judged it appropriate to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve's securities holdings. Almost all participants supported a slowing of the pace of runoff at this meeting. Most participants noted the importance of clearly communicating that slowing the runoff pace had no implications for the stance of monetary policy, would not affect the long-term path of the balance sheet, was a natural progression of the slowing decided at the May 2024 meeting, and was in line with the Committee's principles and plans for balance sheet reduction announced in 2022. Some participants noted that a slower pace of runoff would also help guard against reserve scarcity emerging with little advance notice during a period of potentially rapid increase in the TGA. Several participants did not see a compelling case for slowing the pace of runoff at this meeting. A number of participants commented that the Committee's existing tools could also be used to help address potential disruptions to the market for reserves. Some participants highlighted the importance of the Federal Reserve's ceiling tools and encouraged the ongoing efforts of the Desk to improve the efficacy of the standing repo facility. Several participants observed that the Federal Reserve's traditional tool of open market operations could also be used should signs of reserve scarcity unexpectedly emerge. Many participants expressed interest in continued discussion of technical aspects of balance sheet policy and tools after the framework review is completed.\", \"In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants noted that inflation remained somewhat elevated. Participants also observed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace. They noted that swings in net exports appeared to have not been fully reflected in inventory and spending data, which complicated the interpretation of the recent data on economic activity. Participants further noted that the unemployment rate had stabilized at a low level and that labor market conditions had remained solid in recent months. In this context, and amid a further increase in uncertainty about the economic outlook and a rise in the risks of both higher unemployment and higher inflation, all participants viewed it as appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent.

The staff presentation began by recapping the creation and evolution of the Committee's Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy and the context of the Committee's 2019–20 review. The adoption of the statement in 2012 introduced the Committee's 2 percent inflation target and codified long-standing practices followed by the Committee and, as such, was an important step in improving the transparency, accountability, and predictability of U.S. monetary policymaking. The launch of the 2019–20 review was motivated in part by a desire to evaluate the experience of the Global Financial Crisis and its aftermath. During this period, inflation had run persistently below the Committee's 2 percent objective, even as the unemployment rate and interest rates remained low. These developments indicated a greater risk that the federal funds rate would be constrained by its effective lower bound (ELB) more often in the future, posing challenges to the achievement of the Committee's dual-mandate goals over the medium term. The staff summarized the scope and components of the 2019–20 review, including its outreach to a broad range of individuals and groups, and the rationale behind the changes made to the statement at the end of the review.\", 'Participants viewed the statement as having played an important role in building a common understanding among policymakers of the congressionally mandated monetary policy goals and of their monetary policy strategy. The statement and other means of policy communication also figured importantly in conveying that understanding to the public and helping to anchor inflation expectations, thereby supporting the effective transmission of monetary policy. Participants indicated that they were looking forward to their discussions at upcoming meetings and to hearing a range of perspectives at various Fed Listens events as well as at a planned research conference, and that they were approaching the review with open minds.']' to 'retrieved_answers'\n",

Members agreed that it was appropriate to acknowledge in the postmeeting statement that uncertainty about the economic outlook had diminished but remained elevated, and the Committee was attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.

On net, foreign equity prices moved down somewhat, while corporate bond spreads widened moderately. Market-based policy expectations and near-term inflation compensation declined notably in Europe. The dollar depreciated against many advanced foreign economy (AFE) currencies despite widening U.S.–AFE yield differentials. Market participants generally attributed dollar weakness to concerns about potential adverse effects of trade policy on the U.S. growth outlook.', \"The manager turned first to a review of financial market developments. Over the intermeeting period, policy expectations and Treasury yields rose modestly, credit spreads narrowed, and equity prices increased. Markets were attentive to the de-escalation of trade tensions; generally weaker-than-expected economic data releases, with the notable exception of the May employment report; and prospects for fiscal expansion. These factors, on net, resulted in some paring back of investors' perception of downside risk to growth and upside risk to inflation. Results from the Open Market Desk's Survey of Market Expectations were consistent with this interpretation: The median respondent's expectations for real gross domestic product (GDP) growth and personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation for 2025 retraced some of the moves that occurred after the April tariff announcements, though growth expectations were still materially lower and inflation expectations remained higher relative to the March survey.\", 'Foreign financial markets were affected by investor concerns about global economic growth, in part related to higher tariffs, while expectations for greater fiscal spending in some economies provided an offsetting effect.

Over the intermeeting period, Treasury yields declined, equity prices fell, credit spreads widened, and the dollar depreciated. These moves appeared to reflect increased perceived risks—rather than a base case—of a significant deterioration of the U.S. outlook, as investors responded to both weaker-than-expected consumer spending and sentiment data as well as to developments in trade policy that had raised uncertainty.', 'Administration priorities create an unpredictable trade landscape.

Participants observed that inflation had come down but remained somewhat elevated. Growth in consumer spending and business investment had been solid, though many participants observed that measures of household and business sentiment remained weak. Participants judged that uncertainty about the outlook was elevated amid evolving developments in trade policy, other government policies, and geopolitical risks, but that overall uncertainty had diminished since the previous meeting. Some participants commented that high uncertainty had the potential to restrain economic activity, including private-sector hiring, in the near term. Participants judged that there were downside risks to employment and economic activity and upside risks to inflation, but that these risks had decreased as expectations about effective tariff rates and their effects had declined from levels in April.', 'With regard to the business sector, most participants commented that contacts or surveys reported increased uncertainty about potential changes in federal government policies and a deterioration in business sentiment, which had led many firms to pause their capital spending plans. Several participants highlighted that the auto industry faced significant risks associated with tariffs because of its interconnected and cross-border supply chains. By contrast, several participants noted that their contacts expressed optimism about future firm profitability driven by more business-friendly regulatory or fiscal policy changes or expected productivity gains from artificial intelligence and related technologies. A few participants highlighted the strains faced by the agricultural sector, as tariffs threatened to further compress its profit margins by lowering farm export prices and raising input costs.', \"The staff's inflation projection was lower than the one prepared for the May meeting. Tariff increases were expected to raise inflation this year and to provide a small boost in 2026. Inflation was projected to decline to 2 percent by 2027.\", 'With regard to the outlook for inflation, participants judged that inflation was likely to be boosted this year by the effects of higher tariffs, although significant uncertainty surrounded the magnitude and persistence of such effects. Several participants noted that the announced or planned tariff increases were larger and broader than many of their business contacts had expected. Several participants also noted that their contacts were already reporting increases in costs, possibly in anticipation of rising tariffs, or that their contacts had indicated willingness to pass on to consumers higher input costs that would arise from potential tariff increases. A couple of participants highlighted factors that might limit the inflationary effects of tariffs, noting that many households had depleted the excess savings they had accumulated during the pandemic and were less likely to accept additional price increases, or that stricter immigration policies might reduce demand for rental and affordable housing and alleviate upward pressures on housing inflation. A couple of participants noted that the continued balance in the labor market suggested that labor market conditions were unlikely to be a source of inflationary pressure. A couple of participants noted that, in the period ahead, it could be especially difficult to distinguish between relatively persistent changes in inflation and more temporary changes that might be associated with the introduction of tariffs. Participants commented on a range of factors that could influence the persistence of tariff effects, including the extent to which tariffs are imposed on intermediate goods and thus affect input costs at various stages of production, the extent to which complex supply chains need to be restructured, the actions of trading partners in responding with retaliatory increases in tariffs, and the stability of longer-term inflation expectations.', 'Participants observed that, even though swings in net exports had affected the data, the available data indicated that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace and labor market conditions continued to be solid, but inflation remained somewhat elevated. Participants assessed that the tariff increases announced so far had been significantly larger and broader than they had anticipated. Participants observed that there was considerable uncertainty surrounding the evolution of trade policy as well as about the scale, scope, timing, and persistence of associated economic effects. Significant uncertainties also surrounded changes in fiscal, regulatory, and immigration policies and their economic effects. Taken together, participants saw the uncertainty about their economic outlooks as unusually elevated.

The staff briefed policymakers on lessons drawn from the experiences of the U.S. and other economies with inflation over the past five years and the possible implications for monetary policy.

In their communications, foreign central banks also emphasized the need to maintain policy flexibility amid heightened uncertainty.', \"The median respondent's modal path for the federal funds rate in the June survey shifted higher through 2026 and implied two 25 basis point rate cuts both this year and next year. Market-based policy expectations were largely consistent with survey results, with both the futures-based average federal funds rate path and the options-based modal federal funds rate path shifting higher over the intermeeting period. Overall, the changes in the intermeeting period brought policy expectations for the next few quarters back close to where they stood at the time of the March FOMC meeting. However, futures-based policy expectations beyond the next few quarters had not fully retraced the decline seen over the previous intermeeting period, suggesting that perceived medium- and longer-term downside risks to growth remained larger than before the April tariff announcements. Nominal Treasury yields rose 15 to 20 basis points, on net, over the intermeeting period. The manager observed that the rise in shorter-maturity yields was consistent with the upward shift in the expected policy rate path. The rise in longer-maturity yields appeared to reflect, in part, market participants' increasing fiscal concerns: In response to a Desk survey question about the top factors behind the respondents' forecast of the 10-year yield over the next two years, the fiscal outlook was the factor cited by the largest number of respondents.\", \"The manager turned first to a review of financial market developments. Amid significant market volatility over the intermeeting period, longer-maturity Treasury yields rose, broad equity price indexes changed little on net, credit spreads widened, and the dollar depreciated. The manager observed that market participants appeared to interpret recently announced trade policy changes as a negative supply shock that could restrain domestic activity relative to foreign activity in the near term. The manager noted that respondents to the Open Market Desk's Survey of Market Expectations had materially lowered their gross domestic product (GDP) forecasts and raised their inflation forecasts for this year while significantly increasing the probability they placed on a recession occurring within the next six months.\", 'Foreign financial market moves over the intermeeting period mainly reflected developments in the U.S., including trade policy news and the relative strength of the U.S. economic data releases during the period. The broad dollar index increased slightly on net. Longer-term AFE yields edged higher, reflecting in part spillovers from higher U.S. yields. Stock price indexes increased in most foreign countries, with the notable exception of China, in which equity prices declined moderately, in part reflecting weaker-than-expected forward-looking manufacturing indicators. Capital outflows from emerging markets continued, and several EME central banks drew down their foreign exchange reserves, including their holdings of U.S. Treasury securities, to resist currency depreciation pressures.', 'Over the intermeeting period, the market-implied path of the federal funds rate over the next few meetings edged higher but moved down at horizons beyond September, as ongoing trade policy uncertainty, indicators of weakening consumer and business sentiment, and some softer-than-expected economic data releases prompted investors to become more concerned about higher near-term inflation and downside risks to economic growth. Near-term inflation compensation rose notably, although longer-term inflation compensation appeared to remain well anchored. Nominal and real Treasury yields fell notably across the maturity spectrum.', 'Over the intermeeting period, the market-implied path of the federal funds rate over the next few meetings edged up, on net, but declined somewhat toward the end of the year, as the announcements on new U.S. tariffs left investors more concerned about the near-term outlooks for both inflation and growth. Near-term inflation compensation rose notably, while longer-term inflation compensation appeared to remain well anchored. Against the backdrop of heightened volatility, yields on shorter- and medium-term nominal Treasury securities declined, but longer-term rates rose somewhat. The increase in longer-term yields appeared to be partly attributable to higher term premiums.', 'Economic growth abroad picked up in the first quarter, lifted by the surge in shipments to the U.S.—especially from Europe and Asia excluding China—in anticipation of tariff hikes.

Near-term inflation compensation declined, while longer-term inflation compensation was little changed. Nominal and real Treasury yields increased moderately, on net, across the maturity spectrum.', 'The information available at the time of the meeting indicated that real gross domestic product (GDP) rose at a solid pace in 2024. After a period of considerable rebalancing, labor market conditions had stabilized, and the unemployment rate remained low. Consumer price inflation remained somewhat elevated.', 'In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants noted that inflation remained somewhat elevated. Participants also observed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace, that the unemployment rate had stabilized at a low level, and that labor market conditions had remained solid in recent months. In this context, and amid elevated uncertainty around the economic outlook, all participants viewed it as appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent.', \"Participants noted that the economic consequences of the COVID–19 pandemic were largely unforeseen at the time of the 2019–20 review and that the current economic environment differed greatly from the period leading up to that review, which was characterized in part by persistently low inflation and interest rates. In light of the experience of the past five years, participants assessed that it was important to consider potential revisions to the statement, with particular attention to some of the elements introduced in 2020. Participants highlighted as areas of consideration the statement's focus on the risks to the economy posed by the ELB, the approach of mitigating shortfalls from maximum employment, and the approach of aiming to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent following periods of persistently below-target inflation. Participants emphasized the need for the FOMC's monetary policy framework to be robust to a wide range of economic circumstances. They noted that economic uncertainty—including about the values of the longer-run neutral policy rate, the economy's potential growth rate, and the level of maximum employment—would remain an important factor affecting their decisionmaking. Participants also mentioned aspects of the statement that they thought should continue to be emphasized—including the Committee's firm commitment to achieving maximum employment and 2 percent inflation, as well as the importance of keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.\", 'The information available at the time of the meeting indicated that consumer price inflation remained somewhat elevated. The unemployment rate had stabilized at a relatively low level since the middle of last year, but reported real GDP growth stepped down markedly in the first quarter of 2025.', 'The information available at the time of the meeting indicated that real GDP was expanding at a solid pace. The unemployment rate had stabilized at a relatively low level since the middle of last year. Consumer price inflation remained somewhat elevated.', \"With regard to the outlook for inflation, participants expected that, under appropriate monetary policy, inflation would continue to move toward 2 percent, although progress could remain uneven. Participants cited various factors as likely to put continuing downward pressure on inflation, including an easing in nominal wage growth, well-anchored longer-term inflation expectations, waning business pricing power, and the Committee's still-restrictive monetary policy stance. A few noted, however, that the current target range for the federal funds rate may not be far above its neutral level. Furthermore, some participants commented that with supply and demand in the labor market roughly in balance and in light of recent productivity gains, labor market conditions were unlikely to be a source of inflationary pressure in the near future. However, other factors were cited as having the potential to hinder the disinflation process, including the effects of potential changes in trade and immigration policy as well as strong consumer demand. Business contacts in a number of Districts had indicated that firms would attempt to pass on to consumers higher input costs arising from potential tariffs. In addition, some participants noted that some market- or survey-based measures of expected inflation had increased recently, although many participants emphasized that longer-term measures of expected inflation had remained well anchored. Some participants remarked that reported inflation at the beginning of the year was harder than usual to interpret because of the difficulties in fully removing seasonal effects, and a couple of participants commented that any increase in reported inflation in the first quarter due to such difficulties would imply a corresponding decrease in reported inflation in other quarters of the year.\", \"The median respondent's modal path for the federal funds rate in the June survey shifted higher through 2026 and implied two 25 basis point rate cuts both this year and next year. Market-based policy expectations were largely consistent with survey results, with both the futures-based average federal funds rate path and the options-based modal federal funds rate path shifting higher over the intermeeting period. Overall, the changes in the intermeeting period brought policy expectations for the next few quarters back close to where they stood at the time of the March FOMC meeting. However, futures-based policy expectations beyond the next few quarters had not fully retraced the decline seen over the previous intermeeting period, suggesting that perceived medium- and longer-term downside risks to growth remained larger than before the April tariff announcements. Nominal Treasury yields rose 15 to 20 basis points, on net, over the intermeeting period. The manager observed that the rise in shorter-maturity yields was consistent with the upward shift in the expected policy rate path. The rise in longer-maturity yields appeared to reflect, in part, market participants' increasing fiscal concerns: In response to a Desk survey question about the top factors behind the respondents' forecast of the 10-year yield over the next two years, the fiscal outlook was the factor cited by the largest number of respondents.\", 'Over the intermeeting period, the market-implied path of the federal funds rate over the next few meetings edged up, on net, but declined somewhat toward the end of the year, as the announcements on new U.S. tariffs left investors more concerned about the near-term outlooks for both inflation and growth. Near-term inflation compensation rose notably, while longer-term inflation compensation appeared to remain well anchored. Against the backdrop of heightened volatility, yields on shorter- and medium-term nominal Treasury securities declined, but longer-term rates rose somewhat. The increase in longer-term yields appeared to be partly attributable to higher term premiums.', \"In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants noted that inflation remained somewhat elevated. Participants also observed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace, although swings in net exports and inventories had affected the measurement and interpretation of the data. Participants further noted that the unemployment rate remained at a low level and that labor market conditions had remained solid. Participants observed that uncertainty about the economic outlook had diminished amid a reduction in announced and expected tariffs, which appeared to peak in April and had subsequently declined, but that overall uncertainty continued to be elevated. All participants viewed it as appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. Participants judged it appropriate to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve's securities holdings.\", 'Over the intermeeting period, the market-implied path of the federal funds rate over the next few meetings edged higher but moved down at horizons beyond September, as ongoing trade policy uncertainty, indicators of weakening consumer and business sentiment, and some softer-than-expected economic data releases prompted investors to become more concerned about higher near-term inflation and downside risks to economic growth. Near-term inflation compensation rose notably, although longer-term inflation compensation appeared to remain well anchored. Nominal and real Treasury yields fell notably across the maturity spectrum.', \"In their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace. The unemployment rate had stabilized at a low level in recent months, and labor market conditions had remained solid. Members concurred that inflation remained somewhat elevated. Members assessed that uncertainty around the economic outlook had increased and agreed that they were attentive to the risks to both sides of the Committee's dual mandate.\", \"In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants noted that inflation remained somewhat elevated. Participants also observed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace. They noted that swings in net exports appeared to have not been fully reflected in inventory and spending data, which complicated the interpretation of the recent data on economic activity. Participants further noted that the unemployment rate had stabilized at a low level and that labor market conditions had remained solid in recent months. In this context, and amid a further increase in uncertainty about the economic outlook and a rise in the risks of both higher unemployment and higher inflation, all participants viewed it as appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. Participants judged it appropriate to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve's securities holdings.\", \"The staff's inflation projection was higher than the one prepared for the March meeting. Tariffs were expected to boost inflation markedly this year and to provide a smaller boost in 2026; after that, inflation was projected to decline to 2 percent by 2027.\", \"The manager turned first to a review of financial market developments. Over the intermeeting period, policy expectations and Treasury yields rose modestly, credit spreads narrowed, and equity prices increased. Markets were attentive to the de-escalation of trade tensions; generally weaker-than-expected economic data releases, with the notable exception of the May employment report; and prospects for fiscal expansion. These factors, on net, resulted in some paring back of investors' perception of downside risk to growth and upside risk to inflation. Results from the Open Market Desk's Survey of Market Expectations were consistent with this interpretation: The median respondent's expectations for real gross domestic product (GDP) growth and personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation for 2025 retraced some of the moves that occurred after the April tariff announcements, though growth expectations were still materially lower and inflation expectations remained higher relative to the March survey.\", \"The staff's inflation projection was also essentially unchanged from the one prepared for the previous meeting. Inflation in 2025 was expected to be similar to 2024's rate, as the effects of the staff's placeholder assumption for trade policy put upward pressure on inflation this year. After that, inflation was projected to decline to 2 percent by 2027.\", \"The staff's inflation projection was a little higher for this year than the one prepared for the previous meeting, primarily reflecting higher-than-expected incoming data. Inflation in 2025 was forecast to be somewhat above the rate posted last year, mostly because the expected effects of the staff's placeholder assumption for trade policy put upward pressure on inflation this year. After that, inflation was projected to decline to 2 percent by 2027.\", \"In their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace. The unemployment rate had stabilized at a low level in recent months and labor market conditions had remained solid. Members concurred that inflation remained somewhat elevated. Almost all members agreed that the risks to achieving the Committee's employment and inflation goals were roughly in balance. Members viewed the economic outlook as uncertain and agreed that they were attentive to the risks to both sides of the Committee's dual mandate.\", 'In their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that although swings in net exports had affected the data, recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace. Members agreed that the unemployment rate had remained at a low level and that labor market conditions had remained solid. Members concurred that inflation remained somewhat elevated. Members agreed that it was appropriate to acknowledge in the postmeeting statement that uncertainty about the economic outlook had diminished but remained elevated, and the Committee was attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate. The assessment that uncertainty had declined reflected, in part, a reduction in the expected level of tariffs, which appeared to peak in April and had subsequently declined.', 'In considering the likelihood of various scenarios, participants agreed that the risks of higher inflation and weaker labor market conditions had diminished but remained elevated, citing a lower expected path of tariffs, encouraging recent readings on inflation and inflation expectations, resilience in consumer and business spending, or improvements in some measures of consumer or business sentiment. Some participants commented that they saw the risk of elevated inflation as remaining more prominent, or as having diminished by less, than risks to employment. A few participants saw risks to the labor market as having become predominant. They noted some recent signs of weakening in real activity or the labor market, or commented that conditions could weaken in the future, particularly if policy were to remain restrictive. Participants agreed that although uncertainty about inflation and the economic outlook had decreased, it remained appropriate to take a careful approach in adjusting monetary policy. Participants emphasized the importance of ensuring that longer-term inflation expectations remained well anchored and agreed that the current stance of monetary policy positioned the Committee well to respond in a timely way to potential economic developments.', \"Participants observed that inflation had eased significantly since its peak in 2022 but remained somewhat elevated relative to the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal. Participants noted that the progress in returning inflation to target had continued even though that progress had been uneven. Some participants observed that services price inflation had moved down recently, while goods price inflation had risen.

The option-implied distribution of rate outcomes around year-end shifted to the left and became more skewed to the downside. The market perception that risks to the policy rate tilted more to the downside accounts for the fact that the futures-based expected policy path shifted down more over the period and was consistent with around three rate cuts by year-end. The median modal path for the federal funds rate from the Survey of Market Expectations was not much changed and indicated either two or three rate cuts this year. However, the survey pointed to increased disagreement across respondents as to the most likely path of policy.', \"The manager observed that the implied average federal funds rate path from futures had shifted noticeably lower over the intermeeting period for horizons beyond the middle of this year. By contrast, the implied modal federal funds rate path from options was little changed, consistent with the interpretation that the baseline outlook had not changed materially. The Open Market Desk's Survey of Market Expectations told a similar story, as the median respondent's modal path for the federal funds rate in 2025 was little changed. The expected timing of rate cuts in 2026 and 2027 was brought forward about a quarter, but the expected terminal rate was unchanged. Survey respondents, however, attached noticeably higher probabilities to both lower gross domestic product (GDP) growth outcomes and higher inflation outcomes for 2025 compared with the January survey, consistent with a higher perceived risk of a negative supply shock this year.\", \"The median respondent's modal path for the federal funds rate in the June survey shifted higher through 2026 and implied two 25 basis point rate cuts both this year and next year. Market-based policy expectations were largely consistent with survey results, with both the futures-based average federal funds rate path and the options-based modal federal funds rate path shifting higher over the intermeeting period. Overall, the changes in the intermeeting period brought policy expectations for the next few quarters back close to where they stood at the time of the March FOMC meeting. However, futures-based policy expectations beyond the next few quarters had not fully retraced the decline seen over the previous intermeeting period, suggesting that perceived medium- and longer-term downside risks to growth remained larger than before the April tariff announcements. Nominal Treasury yields rose 15 to 20 basis points, on net, over the intermeeting period. The manager observed that the rise in shorter-maturity yields was consistent with the upward shift in the expected policy rate path. The rise in longer-maturity yields appeared to reflect, in part, market participants' increasing fiscal concerns: In response to a Desk survey question about the top factors behind the respondents' forecast of the 10-year yield over the next two years, the fiscal outlook was the factor cited by the largest number of respondents.\", \"Committee participants continued their discussions related to their review of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy framework, with a focus on the price-stability side of the dual mandate and the FOMC's monetary policy strategy. The staff briefed policymakers on lessons drawn from the experiences of the U.S. and other economies with inflation over the past five years and the possible implications for monetary policy. The staff discussed the role of large and persistent demand and supply shifts, the way production capacity constraints amplified supply–demand imbalances, and the degree to which labor market tightness contributed to inflation both in the U.S. and abroad.\", 'The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023 is primarily due', 'The European Central Bank, the Bank of Mexico, and several central banks in emerging Asia eased monetary policy, citing in part the prospective drag on domestic growth from U.S. tariffs. In their communications, foreign central banks also emphasized the need to maintain policy flexibility amid heightened uncertainty.', 'In discussing the outlook for monetary policy, participants observed that the Committee was well positioned to take time to assess the evolving outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, with the vast majority pointing to a still-restrictive policy stance. Participants indicated that, provided the economy remained near maximum employment, they would want to see further progress on inflation before making additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate. Participants noted that policy decisions were not on a preset course and were conditional on the evolution of the economy, the economic outlook, and the balance of risks.', \"In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants noted that inflation remained somewhat elevated. Participants also observed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace, that the unemployment rate had stabilized at a low level, and that labor market conditions had remained solid in recent months. With the stance of policy significantly less restrictive than it had been before the Committee's policy easing over its previous three meetings, all participants viewed it as appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. Participants judged that it was appropriate to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve's securities holdings.\", \"The manager turned first to a review of developments in financial markets. Over the intermeeting period, broad equity price indexes had declined moderately, credit spreads had remained very tight, and the trade-weighted value of the dollar had risen slightly. In considering the expected path of the federal funds rate, the manager noted that the modal policy rate path implied by options prices had not changed appreciably on net over the intermeeting period and was broadly consistent with a single quarter-point lowering of the target range for the federal funds rate taking place during 2025. The average rate path implied by futures prices was also little changed and was above the corresponding median rates in the December 2024 Summary of Economic Projections. The modal path implied by the Open Market Desk's Survey of Market Expectations shifted up somewhat over the intermeeting period, with respondents generally judging that policy rate reductions would occur later than previously assessed, and was broadly consistent with market-implied paths at horizons up to early 2026. Beyond that period, however, the survey-based path was notably below the market-implied path. This discrepancy likely partly reflected positive market risk premiums as well as survey biases. In their expectations of Federal Reserve balance sheet policy, survey respondents on average saw the process of runoff concluding by mid-2025, slightly later than they had previously expected.\", \"In support of these discussions, staff briefings provided a retrospective on the Committee's 2019–20 framework review and summarized the experience abroad in conducting reviews of monetary policy frameworks. The staff presentation began by recapping the creation and evolution of the Committee's Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy and the context of the Committee's 2019–20 review. The adoption of the statement in 2012 introduced the Committee's 2 percent inflation target and codified long-standing practices followed by the Committee and, as such, was an important step in improving the transparency, accountability, and predictability of U.S. monetary policymaking. The launch of the 2019–20 review was motivated in part by a desire to evaluate the experience of the Global Financial Crisis and its aftermath. During this period, inflation had run persistently below the Committee's 2 percent objective, even as the unemployment rate and interest rates remained low. These developments indicated a greater risk that the federal funds rate would be constrained by its effective lower bound (ELB) more often in the future, posing challenges to the achievement of the Committee's dual-mandate goals over the medium term. The staff summarized the scope and components of the 2019–20 review, including its outreach to a broad range of individuals and groups, and the rationale behind the changes made to the statement at the end of the review.\", \"In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants noted that inflation remained somewhat elevated. Participants also observed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace, although swings in net exports and inventories had affected the measurement and interpretation of the data. Participants further noted that the unemployment rate remained at a low level and that labor market conditions had remained solid. Participants observed that uncertainty about the economic outlook had diminished amid a reduction in announced and expected tariffs, which appeared to peak in April and had subsequently declined, but that overall uncertainty continued to be elevated. All participants viewed it as appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. Participants judged it appropriate to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve's securities holdings.\", \"In support of its goals, the Committee agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. Members agreed that in considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. Members agreed to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency MBS. All members agreed that the postmeeting statement should affirm their strong commitment both to supporting maximum employment and to returning inflation to the Committee's 2 percent objective.\", \"Consistent with the Committee's decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to maintain the interest rate paid on reserve balances at 4.4 percent, effective June 20, 2025. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to approve the establishment of the primary credit rate at the existing level of 4.5 percent.\", 'economic conditions and actions by policymaking bodies are contributing to changing interest rates', 'Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “TCJA”) was $16.5\\xa0billion, with $7.2\\xa0billion expected to be paid', 'Participants viewed the statement as having played an important role in building a common understanding among policymakers of the congressionally mandated monetary policy goals and of their monetary policy strategy. The statement and other means of policy communication also figured importantly in conveying that understanding to the public and helping to anchor inflation expectations, thereby supporting the effective transmission of monetary policy. Participants indicated that they were looking forward to their discussions at upcoming meetings and to hearing a range of perspectives at various Fed Listens events as well as at a planned research conference, and that they were approaching the review with open minds.', \"Participants noted that the economic consequences of the COVID–19 pandemic were largely unforeseen at the time of the 2019–20 review and that the current economic environment differed greatly from the period leading up to that review, which was characterized in part by persistently low inflation and interest rates. In light of the experience of the past five years, participants assessed that it was important to consider potential revisions to the statement, with particular attention to some of the elements introduced in 2020. Participants highlighted as areas of consideration the statement's focus on the risks to the economy posed by the ELB, the approach of mitigating shortfalls from maximum employment, and the approach of aiming to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent following periods of persistently below-target inflation. Participants emphasized the need for the FOMC's monetary policy framework to be robust to a wide range of economic circumstances. They noted that economic uncertainty—including about the values of the longer-run neutral policy rate, the economy's potential growth rate, and the level of maximum employment—would remain an important factor affecting their decisionmaking. Participants also mentioned aspects of the statement that they thought should continue to be emphasized—including the Committee's firm commitment to achieving maximum employment and 2 percent inflation, as well as the importance of keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.\", \"In considering the outlook for monetary policy, participants generally agreed that, with economic growth and the labor market still solid and current monetary policy moderately or modestly restrictive, the Committee was well positioned to wait for more clarity on the outlook for inflation and economic activity. Participants noted that monetary policy would be informed by a wide range of incoming data, the economic outlook, and the balance of risks. Most participants assessed that some reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate this year would likely be appropriate, noting that upward pressure on inflation from tariffs may be temporary or modest, that medium- and longer-term inflation expectations had remained well anchored, or that some weakening of economic activity and labor market conditions could occur. A couple of participants noted that, if the data evolve in line with their expectations, they would be open to considering a reduction in the target range for the policy rate as soon as at the next meeting. Some participants saw the most likely appropriate path of monetary policy as involving no reductions in the target range for the federal funds rate this year, noting that recent inflation readings had continued to exceed the Committee's 2 percent goal, that upside risks to inflation remained meaningful in light of factors such as elevated short-term inflation expectations of businesses and households, or that they expected that the economy would remain resilient. Several participants commented that the current target range for the federal funds rate may not be far above its neutral level.\", 'Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent.', \"Committee participants began discussions related to their review of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy framework. This review is focused on two specific areas: the Committee's Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which presents the Committee's approach to the conduct of monetary policy, and the Committee's policy communication practices. The Committee's 2 percent longer-run inflation goal will be retained and is not a focus of the review.\", \"Committee participants continued their discussions related to their review of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy framework, with a focus on labor market dynamics and the FOMC's maximum employment goal. The staff briefed policymakers on the concept of maximum employment and related labor market indicators. They discussed conceptual benchmarks used in evaluating the position of the labor market relative to maximum employment and in ascertaining the interaction of maximum employment and price stability. They discussed a set of core labor market indicators used to help assess maximum employment, including the unemployment rate, job vacancies, the employment-to-population (EPOP) ratio, and the labor force participation rate (LFPR), and described the use of these indicators in assessing maximum employment during the pandemic-related recession and subsequent economic recovery. The staff also presented model-based analysis of simple monetary policy rules that respond to deviations of inflation from 2 percent but differ on whether they respond to shortfalls or deviations from maximum employment.\", \"Participants assessed that balance sheet reduction had gone well thus far. All participants judged it appropriate to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve's securities holdings. Almost all participants supported a slowing of the pace of runoff at this meeting. Most participants noted the importance of clearly communicating that slowing the runoff pace had no implications for the stance of monetary policy, would not affect the long-term path of the balance sheet, was a natural progression of the slowing decided at the May 2024 meeting, and was in line with the Committee's principles and plans for balance sheet reduction announced in 2022. Some participants noted that a slower pace of runoff would also help guard against reserve scarcity emerging with little advance notice during a period of potentially rapid increase in the TGA. Several participants did not see a compelling case for slowing the pace of runoff at this meeting. A number of participants commented that the Committee's existing tools could also be used to help address potential disruptions to the market for reserves. Some participants highlighted the importance of the Federal Reserve's ceiling tools and encouraged the ongoing efforts of the Desk to improve the efficacy of the standing repo facility. Several participants observed that the Federal Reserve's traditional tool of open market operations could also be used should signs of reserve scarcity unexpectedly emerge. Many participants expressed interest in continued discussion of technical aspects of balance sheet policy and tools after the framework review is completed.\", \"In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants noted that inflation remained somewhat elevated. Participants also observed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace. They noted that swings in net exports appeared to have not been fully reflected in inventory and spending data, which complicated the interpretation of the recent data on economic activity. Participants further noted that the unemployment rate had stabilized at a low level and that labor market conditions had remained solid in recent months. In this context, and amid a further increase in uncertainty about the economic outlook and a rise in the risks of both higher unemployment and higher inflation, all participants viewed it as appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent.
